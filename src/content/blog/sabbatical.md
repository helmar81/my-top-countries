## Amazon has approved three months unpaid holiday

My journey took me from Stuttgart via Istanbul and Kuwait to Mumbai.
I spent some time in India before arriving in Vietnam in late January.
I found a great deal on a flight from Phuket to Casablanca on my way back.
My trip included visiting a friend in the Philippines, enjoying the loevly seaside town Vung Tau in Vietnam
 and going to Thailand and Morocco before returning home.
