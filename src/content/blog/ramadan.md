### It is Ramadan

After my recent trip to Phuket, Thailand, I had the daunting task of finding an affordable flight back home. After researching different flight booking platforms, I stumbled upon a fantastic option that would take me to Casablanca, Morocco, with a brief layover of only 3 hours in Abu Dhabi. Without hesitation, I promptly booked my flight, feeling a sense of relief knowing my journey back would be a smooth and comfortable one. From there, I booked another flight from Agadir to Strasbourg, which is just a 90-minute train ride away from home. This cost me a total of 480 Euro; for a direct flight, I would have paid more than 1000 Euro.

Upon my arrival in Morocco, I observed a noticeable trend of individuals commuting to work without having breakfast or even a sip of water. Many coffee shops and restaurants were closed, and it was near impossible to acquire even a small snack or beverage. Faced with this challenge, I decided to fast during the day as well. However, my resilience faltered until I stumbled upon a McDonald's located at the train station where I managed to order a happy meal to break my fast.

During Ramadan in Morocco, practicing Muslims fast from dawn to sunset. In a country known for its delicious cuisine and culinary traditions, this is no small feat. This includes refraining from eating, drinking, smoking, and engaging in other physical pleasures.

One of the highlights of Ramadan in Morocco is the breaking of the fast at sunset. Families and friends gather together to enjoy a meal after a long day of abstaining from food and water. Traditional Moroccan dishes such as harira (a hearty soup), pastilla (a savory pastry filled with chicken or seafood), and tagine (a slow-cooked stew) are often served.

In addition to the physical challenges of fasting, Ramadan is also a time for reflection and renewal. Muslims are encouraged to spiritually cleanse themselves and strengthen their connection to God. This is accomplished through increased prayer, reading of the Quran, and acts of charity.

Overall, Ramadan in Morocco is a time of community, tradition, and spiritual growth. I cannot participate in religious practices, but I can appreciate and admire the discipline and self-control of those who do. It takes a great deal of mental and spiritual strength to resist the delicious food this country has to offer. I am in awe of the dedication and commitment shown by those who observe the holy month.
