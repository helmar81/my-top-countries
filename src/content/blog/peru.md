## Madrid or Miami
Unfortunately, there are no direct flights from Germany to Peru. The fastest option involves a connecting flight via Madrid. On my return journey, I found an economical flight route through Miami and London, ultimately arriving in Frankfurt.

## Many places to explore
After a long journey, I finally arrived in Lima early in the morning. With ample time on my hands, I made my way to the vibrant district of Miraflores, where I would spend an entire week.

But then things took a turn. My trusty Google Pixel phone took a tumble just three days in, and its shattered screen meant it could no longer capture the amazing sights around me. Disappointed, I decided to focus on etching those memories into my mind instead. With all my senses on high alert, I soaked in every detail of this beautiful country.


### Here a video I have captured while I was in Madrid
