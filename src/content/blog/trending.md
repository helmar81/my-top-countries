### Trending destinations

Excited to get your 2023 travel plans going? Same. Kayak has crunched the numbers on what they think will be the top trends in travel for this year – because what’s the point of having all this travel data if they don’t share it? From the most affordable destinations to those places they think will be “in,” these are the travel trends you need to know for the year 2023.



When it came to 2022 trips, travelers were more than ready – destinations around the country and the world saw tourism coming back. The emergence of “revenge travel” was also too real and there are no signs of it stopping in 2023. So where is everyone headed this year? We’ve got a few educated guesses.

Snapshots in London, Paris and the Amalfi Coast flooded our feeds in 2022 as US travelers were returning to travel. In 2023, we expect to see travelers branch out to destinations in Asia and the South Pacific. Based on our data, here are the places that we anticipate will generate buzz:

## Top 10 trending destinations for 2023:

<ul>

<li>1. Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam
: Searches were up 769% year over year</li>

<li>2. Taipei City, Taiwan
: Searches were up 289% year over year</li>


<li>3. Auckland, New Zealand
: Searches were up 272% year over </li>

<li>4. Singapore
: Searches were up 201% year over year</li>

<li>5. Hong Kong

<li>6. Melbourne, Australia <span>

<li>7. Bangkok, Thailand

<li>9. Sydney, Australia
: Searches were up 145% year over year</li>

<li>10. Tel Aviv, Israel: Searches were up 134% year over year</li>

</ul>

Travelers will be flocking to bucket list destinations in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand in 2023, likely because these destinations have (finally) re-opened to visitors. 

## Which places are cheaper?

Skipped out in 2022 because of audacious flight prices? We hear you – fares this past year were out of control (which might bleed into 2023 too… but more on that later). That’s why we took a look at our numbers to see which destinations are seeing the biggest dips in flight prices:

They might have noticed that Melbourne and Sydney are also on the top-trending destinations list. While flights there are generally expensive, 2023 will see lower-than-usual prices… so this could be your time to plan a trip “down unda.” Additionally, if you’ve had your eyes on Bora Bora, their numbers show flights there are less pricey than they’ve been in years.
