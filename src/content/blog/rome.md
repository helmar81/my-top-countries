### I have now visited 67 countries, and Vatican City was the latest one on my list.

By the way, Vatican City is not a country, but a **landlocked independent city-state** and an **enclave within Rome, Italy**. It is the **world's smallest fully independent nation-state** and the **seat of the Roman Catholic Church**.

### is it worth a visit

Rome is a beautiful and historic city in Italy. It is the capital of Italy and the Lazio region, as well as the home of the Vatican City, the smallest country in the world. Rome is often called the **Eternal City** because of its ancient history and monuments. Some of the most famous attractions in Rome are the **Colosseum**, the **Pantheon**, the **Trevi Fountain**, and the **St. Peter's Basilica**. Rome is also known for its cuisine, culture, and art.


### Accommodation in Rome can be expensive for several reasons, such as:

- Rome is one of the **most visited cities in Europe**, so there is a high demand for hotels and other types of lodging⁴.
- Rome has a lot of **historical and cultural attractions**, such as the Colosseum, the Vatican, the Pantheon and many more, which attract tourists from all over the world²³.
- Rome has a **limited supply of land and buildings** that can be used for accommodation, especially in the city center, where most of the attractions are located⁴. This means that the prices are higher due to scarcity and location.
- Rome has a **high cost of living** compared to other Southern European cities, which affects the prices of services, utilities, taxes and wages⁴.


### book in advance

According to some sources, budget hotels in Rome start around **€95** per night but nicer budget hotels typically cost **€135-€150** per night. Luxury hotels can cost much more, depending on the season, location and amenities. Even a bed in a dormitory costs at least **€55**
